/**
 * map.js — the local server behind the dashboard, and the dashboard's onboarding brain.
 *
 * Serves <workspace>/design-context/ on localhost (dashboard.html as the home page — or the
 * onboarding wizard, served from the template, when the library is still empty) and exposes the
 * actions the static page can't do on its own.
 *
 * Static + legacy map actions:
 *   GET  /api/ping                        → liveness
 *   POST /api/capture {urls:[…]}          → runs capture.js --urls (selective frontier pull)
 *   POST /api/state {slug,name,url}       → records the state in annotations.json + captures it
 *
 * Dashboard-first onboarding (dashboard-first-onboarding PRD):
 *   GET  /api/status                      → {firstRun, product, capture:{running,mode,done}, login}
 *   POST /api/onboard {url,loggedIn,productType}
 *                                         → writes design-context/product.json (url+presets+…)
 *   POST /api/login/start {url}           → spawns login.js --url (headed window; tracks the child)
 *   GET  /api/login/status                → {running, done, started}
 *   POST /api/capture/start {mode}        → spawns capture.js detached; streams via a ring buffer
 *                                           mode:"login-page" = ephemeral signed-out capture (PRD 4a)
 *                                           mode:"full"       = the main crawl (reads product.json)
 *   GET  /api/capture/events              → SSE: one "line" event per capture stdout line + "done"
 *   GET  /api/capture/log?since=n         → polling fallback for /api/capture/events
 *
 * Guided capture (guided-capture-integration PRD, F5):
 *   POST /api/guided/start {startUrl?}    → spawns capture.js --guided --url (headed, human drives);
 *                                           409 if a capture/guided/login already holds the profile
 *   POST /api/guided/stop                 → ends a running guided session (SIGTERM → graceful close)
 *   GET  /api/guided/status               → {running, startedAt, captures:N, lastCapture, capturing}
 *                                           (also folded into /api/status as `guided`)
 *   (SSE) reuses /api/capture/events with namespaced "guided" / "guided-done" events
 *
 * Your designs — the wireframes band (F1):
 *   GET  /wireframes/…                    → serves the SIBLING wireframes/ tree (previews + the
 *                                           wireframe HTML itself), guarded the same way as the library
 *   POST /api/wireframe-shot {file}       → renders a missing preview with shot.js (serialized, one
 *                                           Chromium at a time), then rebuilds so a reload keeps it
 *
 * Copy for Figma (figma-exit-copy-paste PRD, F3):
 *   POST /api/figma-copy {slug, state?}   → records the exit in figma-copies.json (additive) +
 *        …or {wireframe:'<id>'}            (a wireframe copy has no page slug; same file, same rebuild)
 *                                           rebuilds so the "Sent ‹page› to Figma" ledger event shows.
 *                                           The copy itself is 100% client-side; this only logs it.
 *
 * Capture is spawned so it OUTLIVES any one HTTP request (kill-resilience: closing the browser
 * tab must not kill the capture). Job state (line ring buffer, running/exit) lives in this process;
 * the dashboard streams from here and can re-attach after a reload. One capture job at a time.
 *
 * No dependencies (bare node:http). Local only (127.0.0.1). Usage: node map.js [--port 4173]

 * changes three things and nothing else:
 *
 *   1. It binds 0.0.0.0 and takes its port from the environment.
 *   2. It stops reporting the workspace's absolute path, which is a local disk path and

 *   3. It refuses every endpoint that writes to the library or spawns a browser. Capture,
 *      login, guided capture, hygiene acks and annotations are all local-only acts; a visitor
 *      triggering a crawl would be running it on the host's machine, in the host's name.

// SIBLING wireframes/ dir — outside LIB, which is the only tree the static handler serves. Rather
// than widen that root (traversal out of the library is exactly what its guard exists to stop), this
// is a second, explicitly-rooted branch with the same guard. Requests arrive as /wireframes/… because
// the band's srcs are written `../wireframes/…` relative to the library root: over http that resolves
// here, and over file:// (a dashboard.html opened directly) it resolves to the real folder. One
// string, both modes.

// ── Is the baked dashboard behind the design work? ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

// this server only serves wireframes/ as files. So a round written after the last build is real on
// disk and absent from the page — which is exactly what a designer hits, because the wireframe skill
// says to render previews and stop, and CLAUDE.md claimed the band was read "straight off the tree".
// Found by an end-to-end run on a fresh clone (2026-08-28): three approaches on disk, band empty,
// "wireframes 0 · rounds 0", and a hard reload cannot help.
//
// Rather than require everyone to remember `node tools/build-index.js`, the server refreshes itself
// when the tree is newer than the page it is about to serve. Same posture as the rebuilds already
// wired after a capture, a figma-copy and a hygiene action — this is just the one nothing triggered.
// Bounded three ways: only on a dashboard.html request, never while a capture holds the build, and
// skipped when there is no build yet (a first run has the wizard to show, not a stale band). The
// rebuild is synchronous, so that one request pays for it (~2-3s on a small library); a wrong page
